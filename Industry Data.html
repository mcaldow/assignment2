          Throughout assignment 2 the group performed exceptionally. From the first meeting we 
          had already established a rough guideline on what work we want done each week and we 
          were able to keep track of it all through a Trello board. The Trello board made it very 
          easy to access information such as, what needed to be done, when is each part needed 
          to be done, who is doing what, and the meeting times and agendas. The work allocated was 
          flexible so rather than allocating all parts from the first day, we only allocated 
          sections at a time just in case a part took someone longer than expected or other 
          commitments made the section take longer than expected. This proved to be useful, and 
          we believe it reduced stress within the group. Work is set with deadlines being next 
          meeting which assures that each person has content to talk about during the meeting 
          and if they are unable to finish due to an issue they had they are able to bring it 
          up in the meeting to talk about it. We believe this format works well and will continue 
          to use it through assignment 3.
          <br  /><br />
          As for processes we could improve upon or introduce when producing our report and other 
          components of assignment 3. There was common agreement that our meetings should be more 
          structured and the reasoning behind this is that a few of meetings were quite short and 
          didn’t make use of the planned meeting as well as we would have liked to. We have also 
          made better use of time by getting started on this assignment on the first week after 
          the previous assignment was finished. This time advantage should provide us with more 
          time towards the end of the assignment to refine all components of the assignment.
