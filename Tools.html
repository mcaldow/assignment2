            Throughout assignment 2 and 3 the team have utilised other tools to
            maintain a record of who has completed what tasks. As noted by
            Mitchell, the team have used Trello to keep track of the tasks that
            make up the assignment, the team member who is responsible for
            completing the task, the due dates, and the completion status of the
            overall assignment. As a result, the GitHub has only been used
            towards the end of the assignment to update the team website and
            provide the information within this report in a more digestible
            format.

            In saying this, the team have found that the auditing within GitHub
            and the ability review the commits before merging branches have
            allowed the team to ensure that work is not being overridden in the
            event that multiple team members are working on the website at the
            same time. This also allows the team to review the changes made by
            Shanice; who completed much of the initial website design; and roll
            back changes if required.
