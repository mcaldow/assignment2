            <strong>Personal Information</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I was born and raised in North Queensland and lived there until 2019
            when my partner and I decided to make the move to Victoria. In the
            small amount of spare time I have, I enjoy playing
            Metroidvania—style video games and also building model figure
            (Gundam etc.). My partner and I will be adopting 2 greyhounds soon,
            and I cannot put into words how happy that will make me to have a
            pet again. My background in IT is fairly limited, most of my
            knowledge is from mucking about with building PC’s and websites. I
            don’t have an formal training or knowledge that would actually get
            me a job (yet).
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            For my Myers-Brigs Type Indicator I got ISTJ-T. <br />
            It stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging. ISTJ
            indicates a person who is energized by time spent alone
            (Introverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas
            and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on logic and
            reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather
            than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ISTJs are sometimes
            referred to as Inspector personalities because of their focus on
            details and interest in doing things correctly.

            <i>Introvert Waters, n.d.</i>
          </div>
          <p>
            For my learning style I found that I am a visual (38%) and
            kinesthetic learner (36%). I believe I am more of a kinesthetic
            learner though as I am a very hands-on learner. I find it hard to
            learn by just seeing or hearing someone do something. For it to stay
            in my brain as valuable information to retain, I need to do it
            myself.
            <br>
            From doing the Big Five personality test I found that I scored
            highly in Conscientiousness. A person scoring high in
            conscientiousness usually has a high level of self-discipline. These
            individuals prefer to follow a plan, rather than act spontaneously.
            Their methodical planning and perseverance usually makes them highly
            successful in their chosen occupation.

            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            My name is Mitchell Waghorn, and I am 21 years old. I currently work
            as a window tinter and signage installer. In my spare time I like to
            go out with mates or play video games at home. In terms of
            experience in the information technologies sector, I have done a
            certificate IV in programming and have taught myself a bit but other

            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            Myer Briggs: Consul ESFJ-T<br />
            Consul personality types are generally extraverted, observant and
            make natural leaders. Within the workplace people with this same
            personality type have strong practical skill and a strong sense of
            duty. The consul personality type will be beneficial to the group as
            a strong leader is always good to have in presence. Although, the
            consul personality type does have weaknesses. The two most important
            being, inflexible and not willing to innovate as consuls will often
            be likely to follow the path most taken to avoid mistakes.

          <p>
            Style: Strong Kinaesthetic<br />
            Kinaesthetic learners learn best with practical experience
            especially when applying knowledge in a real-life situation and not
            one guided by a teacher or their peers. This is beneficial to a team
            because they often can learn quickly and have good knowledge
            retention when learning kinaesthetically. A weakness is that people
            that learn best kinaesthetically have a hard time retaining
            knowledge through reading or instructions.
            <br /><br />
            TestMyCreativity Creativity Test: 49.7/100<br />
            
            My score for this test accurately reflects my results in my Myer
            Briggs personality test, meaning that the consul personality type is
            more comfortable when taking a path which is proven to obtain good
            results rather than trying something new. A positive to this result
            is that people who tend to be less creative are more often able to
            focus on a task easily without intrusive thoughts occurring. The
            negative to this is that when a task requires design people with low
            creativity tend to fall behind.

            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            I was born in Melbourne Australia where I have lived most of my
            life, my parents are African American and Hungarian. An interesting
            fact about me is that I play American football (Gridiron) which
            allowed me to gain a scholarship for my last year of high school
            where I played for Layton Christian Academy in Utah. Before the
            Covid-19 pandemic I was in line to play college football in
            California for East Los Angeles college, unfortunately those plans
            where ruined due to the state of America. IT has always interested
            me, ever since I was young, I loved playing games and being on the
            computer, some of my earliest memories are me at my grandparents
            playing a pinball game on their PC. When I was younger, I never
            really thought about how computers worked I only enjoyed what they
            allowed me to do, however, in the last half decade or so I’ve become
            more invested on how the devices I use every day work.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            After completing some online tests regarding personality, learning
            styles and creativity I came to find some interesting results. Each
            one provided information that I agree but also disagree with, the
            first test I completed was the Myers-Briggs 16 personalities test,
            this test determined that my personality that of “Protagonist”
            (ENFJ-A/ENFJ-T) which after reading I do agree with this outcome as
            I have always felt like a natural leader. The same can be said with
            the online learning style test I did with educationplanner.org where
            it described me primarily as a Visual learner, again this result I
            can agree with as I have always felt I learn best when someone shows
            me. The last test I did which was a creativity test with
            “testmycreativity.org” was in my opinion incorrect and quite vague
            which was unfortunate.

            My name is Michael Caldow and I’m a 23-year-old Australian that
            currently works full time in a contact centre for a transport
            company. I have Spanish and Italian heritage and I speak English,
            Italian, and French. I have two beautiful dogs. Pepsi an 11-year-old
            cavoodle and Macy a 6-month-old cavoodle. When I’m not working or
            playing with my dogs, I like to run and learn other languages. An
            interesting fact about me is that currently I’m learning Portuguese,
            and I’m aiming to become a polyglot. A polyglot is someone that can

            <strong>Personalty Profile</strong><br />
            Myers Briggs Personality Test: ESTP-T<br />
            The results of the Myers Briggs Personality Test indicate that I am
            a turbulent entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs are often bold and make
            their decisions based on practicality and rationality, as opposed to
            making decisions based on emotion. Entrepreneurs are very direct
            with their communication, so others are less likely to misinterpret
            what they say and mean. Due to these traits, entrepreneurs are
            natural born leaders and thrive in positions of leadership.

            VARK Learning Style Test: Kinaesthetic and Visual Learner<br />
            The results of the VARK Learning Style Test indicate that I am a
            kinaesthetic and visual learner. This means that I learn best
            through kinaesthetic methods which require hands on experience, and
            through visual methods such as the use of texts, reports, graphs,
            and diagrams. The results also indicated that I do not learn very
            well through aural methods, such as listening to
            audiobooks/recordings.
            <br /><br />
            Big Five Personality Traits Test: High in extrovert, agreeable,
            conscientious, intellectual. Low in emotional stability<br />
            The results from the Big Five Personality Traits Test indicate that
            I am outgoing and social, optimistic, friendly, careful, diligent,
            and open to new experiences. The results also advise that I am not
            very conservative nor traditional, and that I am not impulsive in
            nature.

          <h3>Olivia V | Student ID: S3921160</h3>

            <strong>Personal Profile</strong><br />
            My name is Olivia, I’m 27 and I currently work as a support
            consultant for a cloud-based HR solution. Prior to studying at RMIT,
            I completed a Bachelor of Music and a short course in Databasing
            Fundamentals. In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing video games,
            going to the gym (it’s in my garage so “going” is a very loose
            term), riding my motorcycle and hanging out with my dogs and
            husband. Whilst I haven’t had much experience with IT in the
            “traditional” sense (working with servers and networks) and I’m not
            entirely sure what I’d like to do once I complete this course, I’m
            really interested in coding and will probably look at a developer
            role (perhaps UI/UX or full stack).

            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            Myers Briggs/16 Personalities: ISTJ-T <br />
            I am a Logistician. Those of this personality type are defined by
            ‘integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty’
            (16Personalities, 2021). In the workplace Logisiwtician’s are
            described as classic hard-working employees who crave structure and
            clearly defined rules; a downside to being a Logisitician is that
            they may be reluctant to give up responsibilities even when
            overburdened and can be somewhat insensitive and intolerant when
            their co-workers do not share their dedication to a project.

            Learning Style Test:<br />
            I am a kinaesthetic and tactile learner, which means that I learn
            best by doing things. Some traits of a tactile learner include
            excelling at ‘remembering how to do things after doing it once’ and
            ‘understanding how things work’ (The Information Access Group, nd),
            however, tactile learners often struggle with sitting still and
            paying attention; often being labelled as having ADD and ADHD.
            <br /><br />
            Creative Problem-Solving Test:<br />
            My ‘Openness to Creativity’ score was 84/100. This tells me that
            whilst I understand and respect that there are rules and convention
            in place; I like to think outside of the square and come up with
            innovative solutions to problems. Whilst the test tells me that I’m
            not opposed to taking risks and making decisions; personally, I do
            not like to make decisions and would simply prefer to sit in the
            background and allow others to make decisions based on my consultive
            suggestions.
