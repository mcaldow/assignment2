            Throughout assignment 2 the group performed exceptionally. From the
            first meeting we had already established a rough guideline on what
            work we want done each week and we were able to keep track of it all
            through a Trello board. The Trello board made it very easy to access
            information such as, what needed to be done, when is each part
            needed to be done, who is doing what, and the meeting times and
            agendas. The work allocated was flexible so rather than allocating
            all parts from the first day, we only allocated sections at a time
            just in case a part took someone longer than expected or other
            commitments made the section take longer than expected. This proved
            to be useful, and we believe it reduced stress within the group.
            Work is set with deadlines being next meeting which assures that
            each person has content to talk about during the meeting and if they
            are unable to finish due to an issue they had they are able to bring
            it up in the meeting to talk about it. We believe this format works
            well and will continue to use it through assignment 3.
            <br /><br />
            As for processes we could improve upon or introduce when producing
            our report and other components of assignment 3. There was common
            agreement that our meetings should be more structured and the
            reasoning behind this is that a few of meetings were quite short and
            didnâ€™t make use of the planned meeting as well as we would have
            liked to. We have also made better use of time by getting started on
            this assignment on the first week after the previous assignment was
            finished. This time advantage should provide us with more time
            towards the end of the assignment to refine all components of the
            assignment.
