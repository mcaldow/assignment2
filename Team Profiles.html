          <h3>Shanice P | Student ID: S3927620</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            I was born and raised in North Queensland and lived there until 2019 when my 
            partner and I decided to make the move to Victoria. In the small amount of spare 
            time I have, I enjoy playing Metroidvania—style video games and also building 
            model figure (Gundam etc.). My partner and I will be adopting 2 greyhounds soon, 
            and I cannot put into words how happy that will make me to have a pet again. My 
            background in IT is fairly limited, most of my knowledge is from mucking about 
            with building PC’s and websites. I don’t have an formal training or knowledge that 
            would actually get me a job (yet).
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            For my Myers-Brigs Type Indicator I got ISTJ-T. <br />
            It stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging. ISTJ indicates a person 
            who is energized by time spent alone (Introverted), who focuses on facts and 
            details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on 
            logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather 
            than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ISTJs are sometimes referred to as 
            Inspector personalities because of their focus on details and interest in doing 
            things correctly.

            Introvert Waters, n.d.
            <br /><br/>
            For my learning style I found that I am a visual (38%) and kinesthetic learner 
            (36%). I believe I am more of a kinesthetic learner though as I am a very 
            hands-on learner. I find it hard to learn by just seeing or hearing someone do 
            something. For it to stay in my brain as valuable information to retain, I need 
            to do it myself.
            <br /><br />
            From doing the Big Five personality test I found that I scored highly in 
            Conscientiousness. A person scoring high in conscientiousness usually has a high 
            level of self-discipline. These individuals prefer to follow a plan, rather than 
            act spontaneously. Their methodical planning and perseverance usually makes them 
            highly successful in their chosen occupation.

          <h3>Mitchell W | Student ID: S3926443</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            My name is Mitchell Waghorn, and I am 21 years old. I currently work as a window 
            tinter and signage installer. In my spare time I like to go out with mates or play 
            video games at home. In terms of experience in the information technologies sector, 
            I have done a certificate IV in programming and have taught myself a bit but other 
            than that I have no other experience. When I finish my Bachelor’s in information 
            technology
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            Myer Briggs: Consul ESFJ-T<br />
            Consul personality types are generally extraverted, observant and make natural 
            leaders. Within the workplace people with this same personality type have strong 
            practical skill and a strong sense of duty. The consul personality type will be 
            beneficial to the group as a strong leader is always good to have in presence. 
            Although, the consul personality type does have weaknesses. The two most important 
            being, inflexible and not willing to innovate as consuls will often be likely to 
            follow the path most taken to avoid mistakes. 
            <br />

            <br /><br/>
            Learning Style: Strong Kinaesthetic<br />
            Kinaesthetic learners learn best with practical experience especially when 
            applying knowledge in a real-life situation and not one guided by a teacher or 
            their peers.  This is beneficial to a team because they often can learn quickly 
            and have good knowledge retention when learning kinaesthetically. A weakness is 
            that people that learn best kinaesthetically have a hard time retaining knowledge 
            through reading or instructions.
            <br /><br />
            TestMyCreativity Creativity Test: 49.7/100<br />
            My score for this test accurately reflects my results in my Myer Briggs 
            personality test, meaning that the consul personality type is more comfortable 
            when taking a path which is proven to obtain good results rather than trying 
            \something new. A positive to this result is that people who tend to be less 
            creative are more often able to focus on a task easily without intrusive thoughts 
            occurring. The negative to this is that when a task requires design people with 
            low creativity tend to fall behind.

          <h3>Isaac K | Student ID: S3925811</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            I was born in Melbourne Australia where I have lived most of my life, my parents 
            are African American and Hungarian. An interesting fact about me is that I play 
            American football (Gridiron) which allowed me to gain a scholarship for my last 
            year of high school where I played for Layton Christian Academy in Utah. Before 
            the Covid-19 pandemic I was in line to play college football in California for 
            East Los Angeles college, unfortunately those plans where ruined due to the state 
            of America. IT has always interested me, ever since I was young, I loved playing 
            games and being on the computer, some of my earliest memories are me at my 
            grandparents playing a pinball game on their PC. When I was younger, I never really 
            thought about how computers worked I only enjoyed what they allowed me to do, 
            however, in the last half decade or so I’ve become more invested on how the 
            devices I use every day work.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            After completing some online tests regarding personality, learning styles and 
            creativity I came to find some interesting results. Each one provided information 
            that I agree but also disagree with, the first test I completed was the 
            Myers-Briggs 16 personalities test, this test determined that my personality that 
            of “Protagonist” (ENFJ-A/ENFJ-T) which after reading I do agree with this outcome 
            as I have always felt like a natural leader. The same can be said with the online 
            learning style test I did with educationplanner.org where it described me primarily 
            as a Visual learner, again this result I can agree with as I have always felt I 
            learn best when someone shows me. The last test I did which was a creativity test 
            with “testmycreativity.org” was in my opinion incorrect and quite vague which was 
            unfortunate.

          <h3>Michael C | Student ID: S3922875</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
            My name is Michael Caldow and I’m a 23-year-old Australian that currently works 
            full time in a contact centre for a transport company. I have Spanish and Italian 
            heritage and I speak English, Italian, and French. I have two beautiful dogs. 
            Pepsi an 11-year-old cavoodle and Macy a 6-month-old cavoodle. When I’m not working 
            or playing with my dogs, I like to run and learn other languages. An interesting 
            fact about me is that currently I’m learning Portuguese, and I’m aiming to become 
            a polyglot. A polyglot is someone that can communicate easily and effectively in 4 
            languages or more.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personalty Profile</strong><br />
            Myers Briggs Personality Test: ESTP-T<br />
            The results of the Myers Briggs Personality Test indicate that I am a turbulent 
            entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs are often bold and make their decisions based on 
            practicality and rationality, as opposed to making decisions based on emotion. 
            Entrepreneurs are very direct with their communication, so others are less likely 
            to misinterpret what they say and mean. Due to these traits, entrepreneurs are 
            natural born leaders and thrive in positions of leadership.

            VARK Learning Style Test: Kinaesthetic and Visual Learner<br />
            The results of the VARK Learning Style Test indicate that I am a kinaesthetic 
            and visual learner. This means that I learn best through kinaesthetic methods which 
            require hands on experience, and through visual methods such as the use of texts, 
            reports, graphs, and diagrams. The results also indicated that I do not learn very 
            well through aural methods, such as listening to audiobooks/recordings.
            <br /><br />
            Big Five Personality Traits Test: High in extrovert, agreeable, conscientious, 
            intellectual. Low in emotional stability<br />
            The results from the Big Five Personality Traits Test indicate that I am outgoing 
            and social, optimistic, friendly, careful, diligent, and open to new experiences. 
            The results also advise that I am not very conservative nor traditional, and that 
            I am not impulsive in nature.

          <h3>Olivia V | Student ID: S3921160</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Profile</strong><br />
            My name is Olivia, I’m 27 and I currently work as a support consultant for a 
            cloud-based HR solution. Prior to studying at RMIT, I completed a Bachelor of 
            Music and a short course in Databasing Fundamentals. In my spare time I enjoy 
            reading, playing video games, going to the gym (it’s in my garage so “going” is 
            a very loose term), riding my motorcycle and hanging out with my dogs and 
            husband. Whilst I haven’t had much experience with IT in the “traditional” sense 
            (working with servers and networks) and I’m not entirely sure what I’d like to 
            do once I complete this course, I’m really interested in coding and will probably 
            look at a developer role (perhaps UI/UX or full stack).
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Personality Profile</strong><br />
            Myers Briggs/16 Personalities: ISTJ-T <br />
            I am a Logistician. Those of this personality type are defined by ‘integrity, 
            practical logic and tireless dedication to duty’ (16Personalities, 2021). In 
            the workplace Logisiwtician’s are described as classic hard-working employees 
            who crave structure and clearly defined rules; a downside to being a Logisitician 
            is that they may be reluctant to give up responsibilities even when overburdened 
            and can be somewhat insensitive and intolerant when their co-workers do not share 
            their dedication to a project.

            Introvert Waters, n.d.
            <br /><br/>
            Learning Style Test:<br />
            I am a kinaesthetic and tactile learner, which means that I learn best by doing 
            things. Some traits of a tactile learner include excelling at ‘remembering how 
            to do things after doing it once’ and ‘understanding how things work’ (The 
            Information Access Group, nd), however, tactile learners often struggle with 
            sitting still and paying attention; often being labelled as having ADD and ADHD.
            <br /><br />
            Creative Problem-Solving Test:<br />
            My ‘Openness to Creativity’ score was 84/100. This tells me that whilst I 
            understand and respect that there are rules and convention in place; I like to 
            think outside of the square and come up with innovative solutions to problems. 
            Whilst the test tells me that I’m not opposed to taking risks and making 
            decisions; personally, I do not like to make decisions and would simply prefer 
            to sit in the background and allow others to make decisions based on my consultive 
            suggestions.
