          <h3>Mealr</h3>
          <br />
          <p id="Aims"></p>
          <h4>Aims</h4>
          <p>Sommi’s aim is to produce visual representation of Mealr’s mobile application and website so we can market Mealr to investors. As a team that is starting out in information technology, we wish to utilise the skills we have with designing user interface and marketing and are also aware of our limited programming and technological skills. We believe that developing a fully functioning prototype or most viable product of Mealr is just out of reach now for Sommi, however we can create visual representation to illustrate our vision to investors who may be able to make Mealr a reality. </p>

          <p>To produce the appropriate visual representation of Mealr we will need to develop a user interface of Mealr’s website and mobile applications for both iOS and Android devices. Our goal is to ensure that we can show what users of Mealr can expect to see when they open the app on their phone or visit our website. We are aiming to produce multiple high-quality screenshots of each page on the mobile applications to show how users can view high quality meals that are compatible with their dietary requirements and develop a product specific shopping list in the same application. Sommi is hoping that this user interface will demonstrate how easy to use Mealr will be and how much it came simplify the weekly task of meal planning and shopping. </p>

          <p>Sommi’s next goal is to produce a variety of recipes and food products that cater to the specific dietary requirements available on Mealr. Sommi will need to develop a handful of enticing recipes that will be used in conjunction with the proposed user interface to allure potential investors as they will be able to see recipes, they would wish to prepare themselves. </p>

          <p>Finally, Sommi will need to develop a pricing framework for Mealr to demonstrate what features paid users can expect as well as to forecast potential revenue streams. Mealr will have a limited and free version that is available so that users will be able to benefit from the convenience of Mealr and potentially consider signing up for a paid subscription. We believe that it is important to develop a solid pricing framework and to establish what features will be available to paying customers so that Sommi can estimate monthly revenue. This estimated revenue can be utilised when pitching Mealr to investors to entice them to invest in Sommi’s vision of simplifying meal preparation for people with dietary requirements. </p>
          <p id="Roles"></p>
          <h4>Roles</h4>
          <p>
            For every great app there needs to be organisation amongst the team designing 
            and creating it, with SOMMI we have stated earlier that our ideal jobs are quite 
            similar. We have future software designers, full stack developers and even a database specialist, 
            this makes it quite difficult to hand out specific roles as many suit that same 
            role. In saying that, it is important we have roles so the creation of this app 
            is successful. As Mitchell has been the group leader so far and his passion is to
            become a software developer it would only makes sense that he would be our lead 
            software developer, making sure the back end of Mealr runs correctly. He has 
            expressed before that he has some experience in coding as well, therefore it 
            would be best for SOMMI to have him as our lead software developer. Now considering
            the amount of code that would need to be constructed it would not be 
            appropriate for Mitchell to do this all on his own, this is where Isaac 
            would step in and help along the way. Isaac has expressed before that he
            would like to become a software developer in the future and Mealr would be 
            the perfect opportunity to work on his skills. The app is being developed for 
            both major smart phone operating systems and will have its own online 
            website, therefore the coding needed to complete Mealr is going to be 
            quite substantial. Isaac and Mitchell will certainly have their hands 
            full for their first programming role, however as Mealr’s creator Michael
            wants to be a senior developer in the future, he could also help them 
            in the coding process. Not only can Michael help code the app, but he 
            can also lead it correctly as Mealr was his vision after all, having 
            this role allows him to be the all-rounder of sorts, making sure the code 
            is correct and leading team members in the correct direction. Michael as the 
            senior developer makes sense as he will make sure the Mealr will become everything
            he wanted it to be and see that it reaches its fullest potential. Michael
            will be helping everywhere as he will know what’s the best direction for Mealr, 
            being the senior developer, he will also help on the front-end and considering 
            Olivia wants to become a full stack developer after university it would make sense 
            that she deals with the front-end coding of Mealr. Full stack developers typically 
            are proficient in both front and back-end coding, we already have two out of the 5 
            people focusing primarily on the back end so its important we have someone to deal with 
            the frontend. Olivia has already shown throughout her work within the 
            group that she is great at being organised, she has made sure that 
            everything is recorded and is there for everybody in the group to see. 
            When dealing with the front-end it is vital that we have Olivia managing 
            it as everything displayed to the user needs to be well presented and 
            organised. With every app there always needs to be constant tweaks and 
            updates to keep it running smoothly, that’s generally the role of a 
            database specialist, which luckily for us at SOMMI we have Shanice who 
            in the future would like to be a database specialist! We would need someone
            that is great at analytics and Shanice has mentioned previously how that is 
            a specialty she possesses. A major risk to every app is errors occurring or 
            bugs appearing that take gives the user a poor experience, a database specialist
            will make sure that they find bugs before they arise by constantly test the program,
            almost trying to make it crash. For an app as large as Mealr with be with its inventory
            Shanice’s role will be a critical one. 
          <p>Whilst the above roles are those that the team will eventually undertake when work 
            on Mealr begins, the team dynamic within assignment 3 will need to vary slightly given 
            that most of the team do not have the experience to do these roles.</p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, <strong>Mitchell</strong> has taken on the role of team leader and 
            as such has undertaken a role like that of the Lead Developer; his role in this 
            assignment will be to mentor the other team members, plan and document the 
            technical aspects of the project including the progress of the plans initially 
            raised by Michael.</p>
            <p><strong>Michael</strong>’s role is quite similar to that of a product owner; he has 
            approached the team with an idea and his role within the group is to prepare a 
            project brief or user story that the other team members can understand and need 
            to adhere to. However, user’s stories are not without risk, and this is where 
            Isaac’s role will become important.</p>
            <p><strong>Isaac</strong>’s role within this assignment is manage the project’s risks. This 
            includes anticipating what risks Mealr might face and finding strategies that 
            will allow the team to minimise or negate the risks altogether. Whilst these 
            risks will need to be communicated to all team members involved in the Mealr 
            project, someone within the group who will need to be aware of the risks, and 
            more, to the point of omniscience is Olivia.</p>
            <p>Within assignment 3, <strong>Olivia</strong> will be undertaking the project manager role. 
            Whilst this role is similar to that of a lead developer, the role differs in 
            that it is less technically and is more concerned with ensuring that project 
            deadlines are met. Olivia’s key role within the project is to maintain due 
            dates, meeting notes and finalise documentation.</p>
            <p>Finally, <strong>Shanice</strong> will be undertaking the role of the user interface designer.
            Shanice’s role within the team is to ensure that Mealr has an attractive user 
            interface and provides a positive experience for Mealr users. This includes testing 
            to the user interface to ensure that it is user-friendly and providing the Mealr 
            investors with a broad idea of what to expect when the application is finally 
            released.</p>
            <p>All of these roles play a critical part in the creation
            of Mealr, every single member would need to play their part as if anyone doesn’t then this 
            application would never work correctly. Thankfully we in SOMMI work great together, therefore 
            Mealr has a very bright future!

          <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
          <p><strong>How it began</strong><br />
            At SOMMI we are a group of students at RMIT which also work while studying. Due to 
            this we live busy lives. We were tasked to think of and write about a project in our 
            first assignment. All the members of the group had great ideas, from an app that lets 
            you find local liquor stores to an app that’s used in a doctor’s office to help monitor 
            patients. However, one application, originally thought of by Michael Caldow, stuck out 
            to as all, which we ended up calling ‘Mealr’. The idea stuck out to us as it was an 
            application, we could all benefit from as it solves a common problem which many people 
            suffer from which is, lack of time. When you spend less time focusing on what you eat 
            you are more likely to order in unhealthy foods through meal delivery apps such as Uber. 
            With Mealr you are given shopping lists which match with specific grocery stores which 
            cater for the meals you choose, taking time out of deciding what you want to eat and 
            shopping for the groceries. A large part of Mealr is dietary inclusivity. We are proud 
            of our apps ability to cater to most dietary requirements and help people where needed, 
            allowing users to search for specific dietary requirements and be displayed verified 
            recipes catered for them.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Mealr's core features</strong><br />
            Most of the core features of Mealr have remained the same since assignment 2, however 
            there are some minor changes.<br />
            Mealr at its core will be a database which stores recipes which are released on a daily 
            basis. Meals were to be submitted by chefs and users which had an account. Recipes were 
            to undergo analysis to make sure they were of quality and were suitable for the dietary 
            requirements the recipe was listed for. If a recipe is not accepted due to not fitting 
            the dietary requirements but is overall a good recipe, we will verify the recipe but not 
            list it under the dietary requirement. The dietary requirements include:<br />
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vegetarian</li>
              <li>Vegan</li>
              <li>Shellfish-free</li>
              <li>Dairy-free</li>
              <li>Nut-free</li>
              <li>Gluten Free</li>
              <li>Halal</li>
              <li>Kosher</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We will also allow the user to search for specific ingredients rather than whole recipes 
            and apply the same dietary filters listed above to take the stress out of producing a shopping 
            list.
            <br />
            Originally, we planned for non-premium users to have access to three new recipes per dietary 
            filter each week, and premium users will have access to ten new recipes per dietary filter each 
            week. On top of this the users who have premium will also be able to favourite recipes for quick 
            access and even modify those recipes within their app to their own liking. If the user unsubscribes, 
            they will lose access to their modified and favourited recipes, however if they were to resubscribe, 
            they will be able to access them again.
            <br />
            Users of Mealr will be able to access metrics such as, the price of their weekly shop depending on 
            which store they chose to shop from (will change if a deal is made with a grocery store chain), 
            nutritional data if they are a premium user, and if they set a caloric intake goal within the app, 
            they can track their progress.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Key decisions</strong><br />
            When we first decided on Mealr for our project there were many gaps in the overall design and execution 
            of the application. We needed to decide on a few things. How do we make money? What will our application 
            be used on? What will the branding and design of our application look like? How will we develop Mealr?
            <br /><br />
            <strong>How will we make money?</strong><br />
            When the idea of Mealr was created we didn’t have a ‘set in stone’ way of monetary gain, but since then 
            we have come up with a few methods of producing money. There are two streams we can take, the customer pays, 
            or the supplier pays. If the customer was to pay for the product, we would have to create a free app and 
            lock components behind a paywall, and on top of this, would we use a subscription-based model, or a one-time 
            purchase model. As for what we would lock behind a paywall, we discussed that we could have premium recipes 
            which need to be paid for, but the revenue stream probably wouldn’t suffice if this was the only benefit. 
            We them came up with a solution which allowed users who owned the subscription could obtain 10 recipes each 
            week per dietary filter as well as save recipes they like and even modify the recipes for themselves if they 
            wanted to make any changes. <br />
            Our other source of revenue which could be our single source or an additional source of revenue on 
            top of the monthly subscription is getting the suppliers to pay. If we were able to pitch our idea 
            to a company like Woolworths or other nationwide grocery store chains, we could potentially promote 
            their store and products by having our recipes use exclusively their items and even offer rewards 
            for people shopping at the store. Recipes will use products which the grocery store sell, and price 
            data will come from them so that pricing is accurate if you shop at the grocery store collaborating 
            with us. Another potential feature is if the store we work with offers a click and collect service 
            or a home delivery service we could create a quick shop function within Mealr offering the user to 
            select their recipes and have them ordered for an express click and collect. <br />
            Both these ideas to us seem plausible but for us to start up it would be unrealistic for us to expect 
            a large company to work with us, so to grow we will offer the subscription service to our users and 
            in the future, we will look at partnering up with a grocery store chain to expand our application and 
            make it as convenient and functional as possible for our users.<br />
            Further into the future, SOMMI will also look at partnering with influencers 
            to further promote Mealr. In the current market, meal kit services such as 
            Hello Fresh and Marley Spoon are partnering with influencers within the 
            lifestyle, entertainment, food, finance, and 
            gaming categories and seem to be avoiding categories such as fitness. <br>
            Whilst Mealr is likely to follow a similar pattern; the team may be more 
            inclined to branch into the fitness category (despite most influencers having 
            meal and fitness plans) given that those within the fitness community are 
            usually on niche diets such as keto, low-carb high-protein or anabolic.<br><br>
            <strong>What will our application be used on?</strong><br />
            From the conception of Mealr we already knew what our app needed to be developed on. It is vital that 
            the app is accessible on both IOS and Android mobile platforms as we believe the app is most useful on 
            a mobile device, especially for ordering food. This also makes it easier for users to share recipes 
            they find via text or other messaging platforms with their friends potentially boosting the popularity 
            of Mealr. We knew we wanted the app on these platforms, but we also investigated the benefit of 
            developing the app as a website additionally. There are a few benefits to using a mobile website, these 
            being compatibility, a wider reach, and easy support and maintenance. Websites are more compatible as 
            they can be developed on the same platform and can be accessed by users on any device of their choosing 
            as long as it can use a web browser. This feature also attributes to a broader reach as there are more 
            devices which can be accessed. The reason websites are easier to support is due to the fact that there 
            is only one version of them, rather than having multiple for each mobile operating system (Tiana H, 2021).
            <br />
            We have decided that when we start-up we will release Mealr both on Android and IOS as a store app. 
            Depending on popularity of Mealr we will then make the decision to produce a web app
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What will the branding and design of our application look like?</strong><br />
            Before we got a logo for Mealr we wanted a design and colour pallet of what our application will look like. 
            We all agreed that the design needed to be trendy but also fit the theme of our application which was food, 
            specifically, fresh food. The design will not only be used for the application, but also branding for all 
            promotional material. <br />
            We all had suggestions, similar to Woolworths we were all looking at an earthy green colour, although this 
            does seem like a good choice for our branding, we concluded that it was too similar to the branding of 
            Woolworths which could hurt our application in the long run.
            <br />
            What is more earthy than the green of plants, well, the earth itself. We decided a light brown colour was 
            perfect for the app. Current design trends for apps and brands are minimalistic designs and usually one or 
            two colours. We finally decided that the light brown will be the core colour for our app and chose a trendy 
            logo which uses a beige background, the logo in a light brown and surrounding text in a natural green. A lot 
            of colours from our app come from the images of the recipes and ingredients from the quick shop section, which 
            creates a vibrant experience for the user and also directs the eyes of the user directly towards the recipes 
            they can order.<br />
            Given that there is not much that can be improved upon; in relation to 
            application design; Mealr have chosen to borrow aspects of its design 
            from various applications and existing design philosophies. This includes 
            the simplistic button menu located at the bottom of the screen (as seen in 
            the Dinnerly interface) which is reminiscent of the overall iPhone interface 
            and provides users with easy access to favourite recipes, shopping cart and 
            settings and the utilisation of a simple scroll/list function instead of a 
            grid view to ensure that each recipe is provided with a unique space and 
            opportunity to appeal to Mealr users.</p>
            <img src="images/plans-imgs/interface.png" alt="Dinnerly, Marley Spoon and Hello Fresh Interface"><br><br>
            <p><strong>How will we develop Mealr?</strong><br />
            Although we are far from the stage of developing our application as no one in our group has experience 
            developing mobile applications we believe React.js is best suited for our application as its cross platform 
            meaning that we only need one application to be developed for IOS and Android. From the research we have done 
            JavaScript also seems like a good starting point for programmers as it is powerful but also simple to learn 
            and use.
            <br />
            We originally looked into developing on Electron.js which is a JavaScript framework which allows users to develop 
            a web app which can easily be converted into a desktop application. There is a plethora of popular desktop 
            applications which use Electron.js including the Facebook messenger desktop app and the Discord desktop app. 
            Unfortunately for us Electron.js currently does not have a way of turning a web application into a mobile application.
            <br />
            In conclusion we decided with development on React.js for our mobile apps as it makes it easier for us to develop 
            for all platforms and maintain our applications, and if we went ahead with the potential web application for Mealr 
            we will develop using electron.js which will also give us easy access to develop and desktop application. <br /><br />
            <strong>What we have achieved</strong><br />
            As of the 21st of November 2021, we have a designed UI for our application as well as made most if not all important 
            discissions about the creation and planning for Mealr as an app. Unfortunately, within the time frame given none of 
            the team members have enough experience with coding to develop a functional application which interacts with the UI. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Future plans</strong><br />
            After the due date for this assignment, we soon plan to learn how to develop using React.js and the other relevant 
            technologies listed in the tools and technologies section in this report. With the ‘small business grant VIC’ we will 
            be supplied with $30,000 of funding which we can be used to pay design or development costs for the things we are maybe 
            too inexperienced with, or which cannot be learned within the timeframe of us wanting to release Mealr.
            <br />
            After the relevant learning has been done, the point at where we want to start developing is creating a functional UI, 
            using react.js we should be able to develop an app which enables us to go through all menus of the application.
            <br />
            Once we have operational menus and the UI is working as planned, we now want to create functionality to each of the UI 
            screens. The user should be able to add recipes to their shopping list, obtain pricing data from their shopping lists, the 
            quick shop section will be operable. Optionally if we are able to partner with grocery stores, we want implementation of a 
            shopping cart built into the app so that users can use those groceries click and collect services or even their home 
            delivery services. This is the largest part of development which will most likely require the work of an external team if we 
            were to create it in a speedy timeframe.
            <br />
            The last step in the apps development will be to connect a database to our app so we have a tidy and organised way to store 
            large amounts of data. We will need recipes stored, user information stored, and individual shopping items and their prices 
            stored at the least.
            <br />
            After development is finalised and we have a completely marketable application and after sales of our premium membership are 
            made, we will try and obtain a partnership with a grocery store chain, hoping for payment for promoting their products and 
            directing our users to buy their recipe ingredients from the partnered store. If this is a success this can benefit our users 
            as we should be able to reduce the cost of premium memberships and even notify users on specials from the partnered store and 
            bring on an additional point of difference to the product.

          <h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Overview</strong>
            <br>SOMMI have decided to develop an application called Mealr. This 
            application will be available as a mobile application; for both iOS and 
            Android devices; and as a web application for larger devices The purpose of the 
            application is to provide end users with a range of recipes that can be 
            filtered based on dietary requirements and preferences.  
            <br>In the future, the application will also provide end users with the ability 
            to create a shopping cart that is linked directly to their preferred supermarket 
            chain and location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Initial Scope</strong>
            <br>The largest part of realising this project is the building of 
            the application itself. However, due to fact that the team does not possess 
            the required skills to build an application, the team have chosen to focus on 
            developing and presenting the user interface and user experience. This allows 
            the team to present the overall idea to a group of investors.
            <br>Within the time provided the team aims to refine the overall application’s 
            aesthetic and build a shell for the web application based on the colour 
            scheme chosen (see below). The consistency across both the web and mobile 
            applications means that end users have a seamless experience regardless of 
            their chosen device, or if the end user is switching between devices. 
            </p>
            [insert image of colour scheme used]
            <p>From there, the team plans to present a user story based on what the team 
            believes the minimum viable product (hereafter MVP) of the application should entail. 
            <br>If there is additional time, the team plan to expand on the user story and 
            include additional features such as the vertical supermarket integration and recipe 
            budgeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Priorities</strong>
            <br>The main priority leading up to the 21st of November deadline is to refine 
            the application’s user interface. The idea is to study similar applications and
              what the team believe they do well and what needs to be improved upon.  
            <br>The second priority is building a simple user experience that details the 
            users end to end experience when using the application on their mobile device 
            given that the team believe most of the applications usage will come from 
            users whilst they are shopping or “on the go.”  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Limitations</strong>
            <br>There are two main limitations that the team have identified: time and skill.  
            <br>Time is a large factor because many of the students within the group are 
            either studying other subjects or work full time. This means that the overall 
            resource time that can be allocated to the project is limited.
            <br>Another factor that limits the team's ability to produce a functioning 
            product is the team’s current inability to program. Whilst everyone in the 
            team understands the basics of HTML because of assignment 1, and most of the 
            group understands the basics of programming; this is not enough of an 
            understanding to build a fully functioning application. The team also requires the 
            ability to develop within an operating system’s (hereafter OS) specific 
            environment such as XCode for iOS and be able to write in an operating system’s 
            specific language, such as Swift for iOS; to ensure that the mobile or web 
            application performs optimally.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future Features</strong>
            <br>As previously mentioned, the minimum viable product for Mealr is the 
            overall ability to search for and upload recipes based on an end user’s 
            dietary requirements. Future iterations of the application will feature the 
            ability to create shopping carts that automatically scale ingredient 
            requirements based on the number of servings required and will utilise 
            vertical integration with supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths to 
            provide end users with the ability to shop within the application.

          <p>
            <br><br>The team have allowed approximately one month; between the 27th of October 
            2021 and the 21st of November 2021; to complete the above priorities. The 
            team have allocated one week to complete the initial research
          </p>
          <img src="images/timeframe-imgs/gantt.png" alt="Gantt Chart">
          <p>From there, the team have allocated the remaining three weeks to build upon 
            and refine the user interface for both the mobile and web applications, the 
            user experience, and the final presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Expected Outcome</strong>
            <br>Whilst the team do not expect to have a functioning project by the 21st 
            of November, the team expect to be able to present the project idea to a 
            group of investors and demonstrate the overall experience of a typical end user.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Revision of Plans</strong>
            <br>Due to external factors the research phase needed to be extended to two weeks 
            instead of the initial plan of one. This meant that plans such as the user interface 
            for the web application needed to be omitted from the investor presentation. 
            <br>This revision has allowed the team to focus on the quality of work and ensure 
            that the mobile application’s user interface is user-friendly.
          </p>
          <p id="Risks"></p>
          <h4>Risks</h4>
          <p>
            When making an application like mealr there are always going to be numerous 
            risks involved. As mealr can be downloaded on iOS and android devices we 
            expect it will be extremely popular therefore leading to several bugs and 
            glitches being found by the community. To identify the possible risks Mealr 
            faces we must look at the many different working parts that allow for this 
            application to run correctly. Firstly, publishing the application will be a 
            risk as the programming side is an aspect that many of us in SOMMI do not have 
            much experience in. To develop Mealr we would need a solid understanding of CSS, 
            JavaScript, and HTML, we would also need knowledge in Java and Swift programming 
            languages as we want the app to run on all major smart phones. With our limited 
            experience Mealr could be a buggy app that is constantly glitching or even worse 
            may just not work correctly at all. This is risk is one possibly not all 
            companies would face when starting an app, however for us doing this project, 
            it’s a real risk we face and the only way we could alleviate this risk is with 
            us at SOMMI learn and become proficient in multiple programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another risk is that this app relies on the incorporation of supermarket 
            companies, we would need a major supermarket chain agree with us so that 
            we can use their products. Now we believe that supermarkets would love to be 
            a part of Mealr as they would see it as only a positive for their company, 
            however if they did not like the project or simply found no interest in the 
            app, then there would lie a major problem as we would use their products, 
            prices etc to help the user shop for their recipes. Another possible risk 
            regarding supermarket companies not wanting to partner up is the funding 
            aspect. Mealr is a free app that offers a paid subscription to the user for 
            more recipes, this is a great formula to begin a project however if not 
            enough people want to pay the monthly subscription, then the app would simply 
            not make enough money to cover the expenses. If the supermarket companies are 
            not willing to team up, then the Mealr development team would not be able to 
            pay off the loan that would be needed to start the company and would not be 
            able to continue running the company. The biggest possible risk is the fact 
            that a supermarket chain may agree to partner up with Mealr, however midway 
            through development lose interest and decide not to continue the partnership. 
            This would leave SOMMI in a horrible position as they would now be left with 
            a loan to pay off and the dream of running Mealr could die.
