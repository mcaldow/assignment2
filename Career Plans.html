            Within the group there are only three different ideal jobs chosen,
            software developer, full stack developer, and database specialist.
            Software development and full stack development are very similar as
            they are both development roles revolving around creating
            applications with programming languages, however; in a software
            development role you will be creating, testing, and maintaining an
            applications back-end which will contain logic and databases, while
            a full stack developer will primarily by creating front-end UI and
            back-end logic and databases for web apps or websites. Database
            specialists design and install database systems for their employers
            or clients and they can also be a part of the development process of
            applications which require complex databases to retrieve or display
            data. <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Early Career</h3>
          <p>
            The career paths of the group pan out to be fairly similar. All the
            groups ideal jobs require a degree in computer science or a related
            field so each career path will start at the same point, acquiring a
            Bachelor of Information Technology from RMIT. An aspiring software
            developer will often move into a junior development role after
            finishing university. The tasks involved with these roles are
            developing simple scripts, understanding the application lifecycle,
            and the basic understanding of databases and a few programming
            languages. A full-stack developer will have a similar pathway of
            being a junior software developer or sometimes a junior full-stack
            developer. These rolls are both similar however a junior full-stack
            developer will be involved in the development of websites and the UI
            of an application. Database specialists will move into a roll where
            they either manager databases in a variety of different database
            systems or perform data entry and data recovery. <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
          <p>
            Moving on from entry level positions, a software developer who gains
            enough experience as a junior software developer and can develop
            more complex algorithms and understand the entire scope of a project
            can move into a position as a senior software developer. Senior
            developers have more responsibilities which include mentoring junior
            developers and developing more complex applications. Like the junior
            software developer moving to a senior software developer, a junior
            full-stack developer will now move into a senior role with similar
            job tasks. The aspiring database specialist will now be able to move
            into their role as a database specialist after they have gained the
            relevant experience in the previous role. <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
          <p>
            A senior software developer and full-stack developer can work as a
            project lead after enough experience is earned. This role requires
            extensive experience working with code and developing large scale
            applications. It also requires great communicational skills. A
            database specialist could move into a freelance position, either
            creating and maintaining databases for small businesses or working
            on a contractual basis for larger companies. These roles require
            great self-initiative and motivation as you will be working for
            yourself. There is also the potential for full-stack developers and
            software developers to work for themselves.
